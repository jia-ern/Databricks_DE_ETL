# MAGIC [What is a medallion architecture?](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture)
# MAGIC > A medallion architecture is a data design pattern used to logically organize data in a lakehouse, with the goal of incrementally and progressively improving the structure and quality of data as it flows through each layer of the architecture (from Bronze ⇒ Silver ⇒ Gold layer tables). Medallion architectures are sometimes also referred to as "multi-hop" architectures.
