# MAGIC ### Table
# MAGIC - A table is a database entity that stores data in the form of rows and columns.
# MAGIC - A table stores the data.
# MAGIC - A table can only be created or dropped.
# MAGIC - A table is an independent database entity.
# MAGIC - It is stored in physical storage as it occupies real space on systems.
# MAGIC - A table gives results faster.
# MAGIC - We can add, delete or update the data in a table.
# MAGIC ### View
# MAGIC - A view only extracts data from the table.
# MAGIC - A view is a virtual table used to view or manipulate some parts of the table. It also has rows and columns as real ordered tables.
# MAGIC - A view can be recreated.
# MAGIC - A view is dependent on the table.
# MAGIC - It is not stored physically. It only requires some space in memory whenever we run its query.
# MAGIC - A view gives results slower because it has to run its queries each time to retrieve the information from the table.
# MAGIC - We cannot modify data from a view. We can change the data in the base table.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Temp 
# MAGIC - Temp tables which are created to temporarily store data.
# MAGIC - Temp tables gives you the ability to allow all users access to a table while limiting what they can see and protecting sensitive information. 
# MAGIC - Temp tables have the ability to be indexed.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### CTE
# MAGIC - can think of a Common Table Expression (CTE) as a table subquery. 
# MAGIC - AKA. derived table, is a query that is used as the starting point to build another query. 
# MAGIC - exist only for the duration of the query. 
# MAGIC - make the code easier to write as you can write the CTEs at the top of your query.
# MAGIC - can have more than one CTE, and CTEs can reference other CTEs â€“ and then you can use the defined CTEs in your main query.
